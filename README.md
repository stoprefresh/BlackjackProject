### Skill Distillery Week 4 Homework
  Author: Miguel Marsiglia
#### Description

* This program simulates a simple versions of BlackJack. Turns progress starting with the user and offer the options to hit or stay. If a player BUSTs then the round ends with the House winning. If the user reaches a point where they decide to stay, then the turn goes to the dealer. The dealer will reveal their facedown card and begin turning so long as they are below 17. If they get above 17 without busting, then they hold and the final account of the round is decided. The player is asked if they would like to play another round and can choose to stay or leave.

#### Technologies Used

1. Java
2. Eclipse
3. Git

#### Lessons Learned

* This project presented some interesting hurdles throughout development. I came accross a few instances where I was unsure of how I wanted to structure program and decided to try and keep as much of the methods destributed throughout the classes as posssible. I was unable to use polymorphism as throughly as I would have liked and had to change portions of my code to reflect this. I tryed to stay in-line with the idea that this would have the potential to be used as a base template for use in other card games and I beleive I have accomplished this to an extent. I created specialized methods within the Player and Dealer classes so that they might be used later on for different purposes.
